# This is a very basic opencv small project where I used the inbuilt Haarcascade Model as cascade classifier to dteect the face in the whole image 
main concept is 1st take the access of video capture ,video means continious number of frames in a sequence, but Haarcascade model is just able to
detect the face in a static photo or a frame in video we can configure the rate of taking frame and for every frame we will detect the facial part 
and make it detected using a square so the whole procedure is going to happenin a dynamic manner so it will be looks like easily the model is able
to detect the face for Haarcascade model is the camera angle is greater than 45 degree then it dosnt work well here it is very basic part
